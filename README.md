Adaptive Vibration Damping System


Envision a compact, software-first system that senses harmful resonant vibrations and automatically tunes a mechanical system's damping in real time-no heavy redesigns, no expensive hardware retrofits. The Adaptive Vibration Damping System is a lightweight, low-cost control layer that reduces peak vibration, shortens settling time, and protects structures and machines from fatigue, shipped first as a research-grade software + controller reference and later as an embedded OEM module.
